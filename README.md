# Kalman-Filtered Trend Trader: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Agent for Portfolio Allocation

This repository is part of **WiDS (Winters in Data Science)** conducted by **The Analytics Club, IIT Bombay**.

---

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:**  
Simple "buy-and-hold" trading strategies often fail during market downturns, while overly reactive models get misled by short-term noise.  
This project aims to design an **autonomous trading agent** that makes intelligent, long-term portfolio decisions based on the *true underlying market trend* — not just daily volatility.

**Goal:**  
Build a Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent that allocates between a **risky asset** (e.g., SPY ETF) and a **stable asset** (cash) to maximize portfolio value over time.

**Core Idea:**  
Instead of feeding noisy prices to the agent, use a **Kalman Filter** to estimate the true price and its trend (velocity).  
The RL agent learns an optimal policy — when to buy, sell, or hold — from these filtered signals.

## Key Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will learn:

- Reinforcement Learning fundamentals (state, action, reward, policy)
- Financial portfolio optimization and backtesting
- Kalman Filtering and state-space modeling
- Time-series noise reduction and trend estimation
- Custom Gym environment creation for trading
- Training RL agents using **Stable-Baselines3 (PPO, A2C, DDPG)**
- Performance evaluation with transaction costs and benchmarks

## Weekly Contents

### **Week 1 – Foundations of Financial Data & RL**
**Goal:** Build intuition for trading and RL basics.  
**Learn:**  
- Portfolio optimization, returns, and volatility  
- Python tools: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`  
- RL basics: state, action, reward, policy  
- “Buy & Hold” vs “Active” strategies  

**Deliverables:**  
- Download and visualize SPY data  
- Plot daily & cumulative returns  
- Write a short note explaining the RL loop  

---

### **Week 2 – Kalman Filter & Trend Estimation**
**Goal:** Implement a Kalman Filter to extract the true trend from noisy data.  
**Learn:**  
- Hidden-state modeling: [price, velocity]

**Learn:**  
- Using `stable-baselines3` (PPO, A2C, or DDPG)  
- Continuous action spaces  
- Model saving, loading, and evaluation  

**Deliverables:**  
- Trained RL model (e.g., `ppo_portfolio_trader.zip`)  
- Training plots showing portfolio performance  

---

### **Week 5 – Backtesting & Performance Evaluation**
**Goal:** Evaluate on unseen test data.  
**Learn:**  
- Backtesting concepts  
- Metrics: Sharpe ratio, drawdown, cumulative return  
- Compare against Buy & Hold and SPY benchmark  

**Deliverables:**  
- “Money Plot” comparing all strategies  
- Summary of results and performance insights  

---

### **Week 6 – Insights, Optimization & Presentation**
**Goal:** Finalize, analyze, and showcase your work.  
**Learn:**  
- Sensitivity to transaction costs and model parameters  
- Documentation and storytelling for projects  
- Preparing a professional README and result plots  

**Deliverables:**  
- Final GitHub repo with:
  - Money Plot  
  - Filter visualization  
  - README.md + short project report  

---

## Final Deliverable

A **complete end-to-end system** that integrates:
[Stock Data] → [Kalman Filter] → [Trend Estimate] → [RL Agent (PPO)] → [Allocation %] → [Portfolio Value]


**Success Metric:**  
Your agent’s portfolio curve beats both **Buy & Hold** and **SPY** over unseen test data (2023–2024).
